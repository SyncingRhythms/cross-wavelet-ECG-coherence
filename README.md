# Cross-wavelet Coherence of Respiratory Sinus Arrythmia recorded by ECG for Parent and Child

I wrangled respiratory sinus arrythmia (RSA) data for parent and child (mean age 9), that was recorded with electrocardiogram (ECG) during baseline and stress conditions (movie viewing). I computed cross-wavelet coherence between the parent and child RSA time courses, to examine parasympathetic syncrhony at varying temporal periods (.5-64 secs) and environmental contexts (baseline vs stress). Additionally, I examined dynamic correlations of stress coherence, at each time-period, with subjective reports of food insecurity, finding some interesting patterns that did not survive multiple comparisons corrections. Using baseline-adjusted stress coherence in future dynamic correlation analyses may provide stronger signal.
